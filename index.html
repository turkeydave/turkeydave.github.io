I did not have a typical career path: I worked in construction through college, moved to Colorado to be a ski bum, and prolonged my professional career for 10 years.
Eventually I moved down to Denver to get a real job.  While in Summit County, I was a snowcat operator, adaptive ski instructor, and 'service worker'.
I was always a top performer and a leader.  In construction, I was a foreman then supervisor, then partner, while still being top concrete finisher.  With snowcats, I soon became a shift/team lead in snow cats, and went on to become "2000 groomer of the year" of all of Breckenridge.
In software I've been developer, team lead, tech lead, and ultimately engineering manager with dozens of direct reports.

Individually and personally, you'll find my soul and spirit in nature, and more specifically in the mountains.

I love technology and for some reason it comes easily and naturally for me.
I love learning better ways to create software systems; I thrive on new ideas/concepts.
I stand for continuous improvement and innovation.

<pre>
Technology, software development practices, and deployment environments (cloud!) changes quickly. I've dedicated the last 15 years keeping up on learning technologies and software best practices.
My ultimate goal is to create architectures, software, systems that can easily accept change - ready to adapt to the constantly changing needs of the business.
I love finding new ways of doing things.

I know that more adaptive code and systems will allow the company to both accomplish its goals and pivot quickly for new ones.
I love to teach / mentor / and guide others to do the same.

As I got older, I've challenged myself to continually grow.  My Engineering Manager role opened my eyes to many things I'd yet to learn.  This was the first time I could't run from the uncomfortable.
I began to learn about difficult relationships that HAD to be dealt with.
I began to learn how to have tough conversations.
I began to learn how to motive and inspire people.
I began to learn about organization change management.

I love to tackle the hardest problems head on.  I research, find the best alternatives, and get a prototype moving.  I love to think outside the box, look at the bigger picture, and daydream different ways of thinking about a given problem.
I pour my heart into the effort.

BHAG REVEAL - I intend to be CTO or start a business within 24-36 months.  To that end, I need to arm myself with all the right tools.  I know I have lots to learn and room for personal growth.

At the bare minimum I've set a personal goal of getting better at all of my personal interactions with others.  I want to improve on projecting positivity, enthusiasm and confidence, and be more patient with sudden situations.

Many large changes are coming to our application systems and architecture.
Message based architecture, evolving front-end technology stack for living apps, domain refactoring (calendaring, multi-location), test automation, and devops SDLC continuous delivery pipelines are all scheduled for 2017.

All of these will require big shifts in both process and thinking of our team members and company.  I'll need to prepare us for these changes and guide us through the implementation.  I need to become a ninja in change management; jedi in cultivating ownership and buy-in.

I know I can help the company meet its goals even more as I continue to improve and thus better impact our customer's lives and businesses.
